After C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17.[22] After becoming finalized in February 2020,[23] a draft of the C++20 standard was approved on 4 September 2020 and officially published on 15 December 2020.
