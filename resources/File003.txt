In 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input/output library. The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy[1] (who had previously suggested Unix pipes).
In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.[20] The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.[17
